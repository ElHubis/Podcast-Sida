<div class="about_pod">
<p>
    Webbpodden was started in 2022 by Ruben Mancos and Ward Dabbah.
    The podcast is about all things internet, (hence the name) but
    especially likes to look through and discuss the darker parts
    of the world wide web that connects us. The podcast began with our episode
    about the darkweb and represnts perfectly what our podcast is about,
    we find nothing more interesting than taking a peek at all things hidden
    and obscured. When we do this we don't just find what's out there, but
    also give out best efforts to find out how it works, all the way from
    the code to the economic systems. Even though the internet often can
    be a dark place there is almost always something good to find in those
    deep dark corners and we enjoy observing that just as much as the
    'bad' part of the web. If you want to see what hidden things there are
    to be found in our digital world, you have come to the right place.

    <p>
        Webbpodden is a podcast that likes to discover and investigate
        the parts of the internet that are often hidden from the public view.
        Together with the Hosts Ruben and Ward we take a look at the darkweb
        and the deepweb, encryption and onion browsers. There our hosts find
        everything from illegal weapons deals and drug sales to the chatrooms
        of whistleblowers. Follow our hosts down this rabbit hole if the dark
        corners of the internet pique your interest
